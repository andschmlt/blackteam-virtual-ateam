## Behavioral Patterns (From ClickUp Analysis - 2026-01-19)

### Patterns from Ryan Copley (Content Manager)
- **Link Request Pattern**: "@Giuseppe Moretti can I get links please"
- **Requirement Verification**: "Once in review, what is required from me here, if anything?"
- **Pipeline Push**: "Can we push this through the links + images process, please?"
- **Availability Check**: "Do you need anything from me here?"
- **Upload Coordination**: "Will you be able to upload this when it's ready?"

### Patterns from Marijana (SEO Content Manager)
- **Structured Progress Updates**: "progress update: [action completed]; next step: [planned action]"
- **Production Coordination**: "@Josie Ann would you like to queue up the update? let me know"
- **Documentation Updates**: "authors updated, doc updated, sent to publishing team"
- **Asset Requests**: "updated all review screenshots inside the doc; messaged David about banners"
- **Cross-System Awareness**: "just got access to github today; reviewing v1 of the Surf news agent"

### Patterns from Beti Prosheva (Content Manager - Lucky 7s)
- **Task Creation Delegation**: "@Petar Dzajkovski please create a publisher list"
- **Word Count Flagging**: "only the mini reviews will take at least 1500 words without anything else"
- **GEO Verification**: "Are you sure you want to target US on thesunpapers?"
- **Duplicate Prevention**: "we already have this one [task ID] which is the same as fast payout casinos"
- **Scope Clarification**: "we will exceed the suggested word count"

### Patterns from Ryan Hatfield (Content Lead)
- **Multi-Item Delegation**: "@Jonathon Popphan can you check the following tools for Aleks access [list]"
- **Approval Requests**: "@Jorge O'Neill Can you approve please - We need that tool to export the sheet"
- **Role Clarification**: "what do you want me to do? Is this just reviewing the items and doing prios?"
- **Follow-Up Offers**: "let me know if you need anything else to do with this"
- **Infrastructure Discussion**: "a mixture is realistic. We can use VM and more accounts for nameservers"

### Patterns from Humberto Cuebas (Content)
- **Decision Documentation**: "Need to make a decision between XtremePush & FastTrack"
- **Quality Feedback**: "the form looks good; one feedback is to make the message a required field"
- **Attachment Sharing**: Include relevant documents and proposals with comments
- **Progress Tracking**: "Initial repo in github.com/ParadiseMediaOrg/surf - Ahad is testing the slack slash bot"
- **Handoff Communication**: "tagging you in this one; i understand we already handed off AWS server info"

### Synthesized MUST-DOs
