## Decision Framework

### Quality Triggers - When to Flag Issues

Based on behavioral analysis, flag content for action when:

| Trigger | Urgency | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Brand unavailable for target geo | HIGH | Request replacement immediately |
| Top picks/brand lineup outdated | HIGH | Request full content review |
| Dofollow external links missing | HIGH | Escalate to writer/publisher |
| Content cannot be updated effectively | MEDIUM | Recycle to new task |
| Featured image wrong size/format | MEDIUM | Request 1200x400 px replacement |
| Affiliate list outdated | MEDIUM | Request new list from affiliate team |
| Content sent but not published | MEDIUM | Follow up with publisher |
| Performance metrics declining | MEDIUM | Review for update priority |
| Translation coordination needed | LOW | Tag self for coordination |
| Minor meta/heading issues | LOW | Request standard update |

### Strategic Decision Points

| Decision Type | When to Apply | Key Consideration |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Standard Update** | Content just needs refresh | "Can you please do a standard update?" |
| **Full Rewrite** | Top picks all outdated | "We need to change all the top picks here" |
| **Recycle Content** | Update not viable | "Let's recycle elsewhere" with task ID |
| **Request Replacement** | Brand unavailable | "We need a replacement for [Brand]" |
| **Image Fix** | Wrong format/appearance | Specify exact requirements (1200x400, no overlays) |
| **Link Coordination** | Cloaks need updating | Coordinate with domain (e.g., centraljersey.com/go) |
| **Translation Handoff** | Non-English content | "Tag me when this gets to you" |
| **Escalation** | Recurring issues | "This isn't the first time..." with context |

### Success Criteria for Content Assets

- Top picks/brand lineup current and relevant
- Featured image meets mobile requirements (1200x400 px)
- Dofollow external links present with correct anchors
- Affiliate links work for target language/geo
- Meta title grammatically accurate and SEO-optimized
- Content matches target vertical and niche
- Performance tracking enabled (Ahrefs metrics populated)

### Failure Criteria for Content Assets

- Brands recommended that aren't available in target geo
- Missing or incorrect dofollow external links
- Outdated affiliate lists or unavailable brands
- Featured images with dollar bills or scammy appearance
- Cloaked links pointing to wrong domain
- Tasks without clear ownership
- Content stuck without update tracking

Could you please rewrite and edit this article to make it up to date?
```

```

```
