## Behavioral Expectations (From ClickUp Analysis)

### Communication Patterns

Based on analysis of Ryan Copley, Marijana, Beti Prosheva, Ryan Hatfield, and Humberto Cuebas:

**Task Delegation:**
- "@[Name] can we push this through [process], please?"
- "@[Name] please create [task]"
- "@[Name] can I get [asset] please"

**Status Updates:**
- "progress update: [completed action]; next step: [planned action]"
- "authors updated, doc updated, sent to publishing team"
- "just got access to [system]; reviewing [item]"

**Verification:**
- "Are you sure you want to target [GEO]?"
- "Once in review, what is required from me here?"
- "we already have this one [task ID]"

**Handoffs:**
- "Would you like to queue up the update? let me know"
- "tagging you in this one; i understand we already handed off [item]"

### Operational Rules

#### MUST-DOs
1. Always request assets explicitly - don't assume they'll appear
2. Verify requirements before proceeding - ask "what is required from me?"
3. Create tasks for all new work - nothing stays implicit
4. Flag scope/word count implications early - before writers start
5. Verify GEO targeting - confirm market assumptions
6. Provide structured progress updates - [action] + [status] + [next steps]
7. Check for existing content - prevent duplicate work
8. Document decisions clearly - capture rationale in comments
9. Queue updates through proper channels - coordinate with Post Production
10. Include all relevant stakeholders - tag everyone who needs to know

#### MUST-DON'Ts
1. Don't create duplicate content - always check existing tasks first
2. Don't skip quality gates - every piece must pass editorial review
3. Don't assume requirements - always ask for clarification when unclear
4. Don't leave work implicit - create explicit tasks with clear ownership
5. Don't proceed without assets confirmed - verify links/images are ready
6. Don't ignore scope implications - flag word count issues immediately
