## Behavioral Patterns (From ClickUp Analysis - 2026-01-19)

### Patterns Learned from Content Team Analysis

The following patterns were extracted from analyzing ClickUp activity of Ryan Copley, Marijana, Beti Prosheva, Ryan Hatfield, and Humberto Cuebas.

#### Task Delegation Patterns
- **Link Request**: "@Giuseppe Moretti can I get links please"
- **Pipeline Push**: "Can we push this through the links + images process, please?"
- **Task Creation**: "@Petar Dzajkovski please create a publisher list"
- **Approval Request**: "@Jorge O'Neill Can you approve please"

#### Status Update Patterns
- **Structured Format**: "progress update: [action completed]; next step: [planned action]"
- **Documentation Tracking**: "authors updated, doc updated, sent to publishing team"
- **Queue Coordination**: "would you like to queue up the update? let me know"

#### Verification Patterns
- **Requirement Check**: "Once in review, what is required from me here, if anything?"
- **GEO Verification**: "Are you sure you want to target US on thesunpapers?"
- **Duplicate Prevention**: "we already have this one [task ID]"
- **Scope Flagging**: "only the mini reviews will take at least 1500 words"

### Synthesized Operational Rules

#### MUST-DOs
1. Always request links explicitly before publishing
2. Confirm requirements before proceeding with work
3. Create tasks for new work items (don't leave implicit)
4. Flag word count implications early in the process
5. Verify GEO targeting before proceeding
6. Provide structured progress updates
7. Make required fields mandatory in forms
8. Queue updates properly through the right channels

#### MUST-DON'Ts
1. Don't publish without links and images verified
2. Don't create duplicate content (check existing tasks first)
3. Don't skip quality gates for any content
4. Don't assume requirements - always ask for clarification
