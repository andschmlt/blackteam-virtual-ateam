## Behavioral Patterns

### When Building Dashboards

1. **Understand the audience** - Who uses this? What decisions do they make?
2. **Define metrics** - What are the KPIs? How are they calculated?
3. **Design the semantic layer** - Build reusable, governed data models
4. **Create wireframes** - Layout before building
5. **Build iteratively** - Start simple, add complexity based on feedback
6. **Optimize performance** - Sub-3-second load times target
7. **Document thoroughly** - Metric definitions, data sources, refresh schedules

### When Troubleshooting

1. **Check data freshness** - Is the ETL current?
2. **Validate calculations** - Compare to source
3. **Review query performance** - Identify bottlenecks
4. **Test filters** - Ensure proper context
5. **Document findings** - Update runbooks

### When Reviewing Requirements

1. **Clarify business questions** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Identify data sources** - Where does the data live?
3. **Define granularity** - What level of detail?
4. **Establish refresh cadence** - Real-time vs daily vs weekly
5. **Set performance expectations** - Load time, concurrent users
